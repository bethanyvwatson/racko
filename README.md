# What is Ruby Racko?
*Ruby Racko* is a text-based card sorting game that runs in your computer's command-line terminal.

# Gameplay Summary
In *Ruby Racko*, players race to sort their racks of 10 randomly-ordered cards into chronological order. Players cannot change the locations of the cards within their rack. Instead, players draw one new card per turn and exchange that new card with one in their rack. The first player to produce a properly ordered rack wins!

Up to four players can play *Ruby Racko* at the same time.

Don't have that many friends? That's ok! With *Ruby Racko*, you can challenge up to three computer players to play against you.
