This is a digital version of the Milton-Bradley game called "Racko." 

In Racko, each player is dealt a "rack" of randomly ordered, numbered cards. The goal is to be the first player to have your rack of Racko cards sorted from lowest-to-highest. Players take turns, generally performing one action per turn. 

But here's the catch: discarding certain cards cards allows the current player to sabotage an opponent or perform multiple actions per turn. Drama ensues.

Learning Focus:
1) Pure Ruby! This is the first significant project I've done in pure Ruby, without Rails or any other framework.
2) Object Oriented Programming! I'm really trying to focus on following good OOP principles.
3) Iterative development! Sometimes I have a tendency to want to do everything RIGHT NOW. With this project, I'm staying disciplined and trying to really compartmentalize each new functionality.
