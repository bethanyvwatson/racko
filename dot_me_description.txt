Milton-Bradley owns "Racko" in real life. This is an imitation. 

In Racko, each player is dealt a "rack" of randomly ordered, numbered cards. The goal is to be the first player to have your rack of Racko cards sorted from lowest-to-highest. Players take turns, generally performing one action per turn. Some cards allow players to perform special actions.

Playing Racko simply made me want to code it! The UI is simple, command-line based because I didn't want to get bogged down in design. I look forward to the challenge of writing beatable computer players.

Learning Focus:
1) Pure Ruby! This is the first significant project I've done in pure Ruby, without Rails or any other framework.
2) Iterative Development! Sometimes I have a tendency to want to do everything RIGHT NOW. With this project, I'm staying disciplined and trying to really compartmentalize each new functionality.
