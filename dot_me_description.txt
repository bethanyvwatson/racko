Milton-Bradley owns "Racko" in real life. This is an imitation. 

Although still a work in progress, you can play "Ruby Racko" right now. Play against up to three computer players, or challenge your friends!

"Ruby Racko" is a command-line version of Milton-Bradley's "Racko". Each player starts with a rack of 10 numbered cards in random order; the rack exists to preserve the order of the cards. Taking turns, players race to sort their rack of cards from low-to-high by drawing a new card and exchanging it (or not!) with a card in their rack. The first player to have a fully sorted rack wins!

Future work for "Ruby Racko" includes:
- Improved logic for computer players.
- Varying difficulty levels for computer players.
- Introducing the special "prime number" cards that make "Racko" actually challenging.
