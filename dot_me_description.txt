Milton-Bradley owns "Racko" in real life. This is an imitation. 

Playing Racko simply made me want to code it! The UI is simple, command-line based because I didn't want to get bogged down in design. I look forward to the challenge of writing beatable computer players.

Learning Focus:
1) Pure Ruby! This is the first significant project I've done in pure Ruby, without Rails or any other framework.
2) Iterative Development! Sometimes I have a tendency to want to do everything RIGHT NOW. With this project, I'm staying disciplined and trying to really compartmentalize each new functionality.
